Alembic commands should be run from the directory both the alembic directory
and alembic.ini file.

The file `../sql/schema.sql` can be regenerated with:

alembic upgrade head --sql

Creating a new revision to make changes can be started with:

alembic revision -m "<message on change being made>"

then edit the generated file in `alembic/versions/`
