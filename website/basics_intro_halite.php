                <p>In this tutorial, we're going to walk you through the basics of the Halite competition. We'll cover:
                <ul>
                    <li>How to submit a bot to the competition</li>
                    <li>The rules of the game</li>
                    <li>How to run games locally on your computer</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Halite Overview</h3>

                <h3>Submitting a Bot</h3>

                <p>The first thing we're going to go through is how to submit a bot to the Halite competition. The bot will be rather bad at playing the game, making only random moves, but that's okay, because what's more important is that it provides a base from which to work up to a competition-winning bot. The reason we're showing you how to submit first is that the servers take time to run games; the goal is that by the time you finish the rest of this tutorial, some results will be up for you to check on afterwards.</p>
