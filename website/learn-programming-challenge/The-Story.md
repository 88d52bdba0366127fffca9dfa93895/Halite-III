When last we met, Halite 1 was fought for in the trenches of a battlefield. The fearsome battle, fraught with peril, had left the planet desolate. All the Halite had been mined, and no clear winner had emerged. No faction wished to yield, knowing that he who controls the halite controls all. Alas, since then the people of the Halite have evolved beyond simple on-ground battlefields and are vying for true control of the universe. The war rages on, but whom of the Halatians shall prevail?
 
## Background from the General
 
In the vast expanse of our universe, four Halitian factions fight for control of solar systems and masses of the Halite.  Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to command a flotilla of ships representing our faction and defend our people from the dreadful enemies. As the leaders of our faction, we offer you three ships and no plan for reinforcements. Unfortunately, due to the scale of this war and the sheer distance from our home, it is a literal impossibility to assure you a larger command.. But fear not, each of our ships comes pre-installed with the Replicatron 5000: as soon as you feed a ship enough of the precious Halite, it will immediately create new ships for you. We have planned to send you to a solar system bursting with the Halite, which, for a skilled commander like you,should be an easy task. Our lead scientist should forthright provide you with more information.  Good luck with your journey.
 
P.S: Your battle holodeck might look a bit dated, not to worry, our over the subspace upgrade to your holodeck experience will reach you within 30 turns of the Halite I sun.
 
## Science from the Lead Scientist
 
Pleasure to meet you, commander. As you well know, we have only just started this space race, and we are in many ways are still novices. The good news is that through our double-agents and counter intelligence, we have found out that our enemies are no better off than we are. We may have conquered some space, but we have only done so in two dimensions. You scoff, but I assure you it’s a harder problem than it seems: we have found that turning in space is quite a challenge when your ship is made of salt. For this and other similar reasons, we have not been able to effectively counter-balance inertia. The good news, however, is that we have ventured into only solar systems that are replete with an element we call “Ether” (you may also know this as fluidic space). This Ether, which permeates the surrounding space, keeps our ships from only accelerating as they would in a  pure vacuum. Thus, you can accelerate at up to 10 parsecs/turns^2, but the Ether decelerates you at a constant 3 parsecs/turns^2.
 
Oh yes, this reminds me of our second problem: our ships’ processors are also made of salt and therefore can not heat too much, so we have not been able to achieve great clock speeds. As such, you may only issue one command per cycle, which equates to a turn, which we have calculated equates to roughly 2 seconds. The flip side to this problem that the blasters are also made of salt, so they also can only shoot a certain amount of energy per turn. Faster clocks would not have helped you much there anyway. No, I’m not joking, and please stop asking why I’m so obsessed with salt. 
 
In even better news,I am happy to share that you have access to a personal computer made of the best cumulus nimbus the galaxy has to offer to precompute the moves prior to passing them to the slower ship computers. Please do note that due to the nature of the cumulus nimbus, it may be used by anyone, including our enemies; though we have done our best to protect our part of the computer, understand that it is ultimately shared. This is, incidentally, why we couldn’t use the nimbus for the ship processor (in case you are curious).
 
I am sure you are wondering how battles rage in this two-dimensional galaxy. All ships have equal destructive power and ships spread their fire equally between all enemies within range. Should be easy shots for a skilled captain like you. If one single enemy ship is in range for two turns, your ship will promptly destroy it, but your ship will be destroyed as well due to the equal strength of individual ships.. However, if you encounter two enemy ships, your blaster will destroy neither, but rather half-destroy each, and you shall be fully shot down. I would avoid these encounters if I were you.
 
On to the best part, as you’re not travelling into unchartered territory for just the dog-fights (at least I hope not), but rather to mine the glorious Halite. To mine the Halite, you need to conquer and colonize a planet rich with the Halite. Our team of ship scientists have significantly simplified this matter: when in close reach of a planet, issue a command to dock, and your ship will know what to do. Docking takes 5 turns and turns off all ship systems unrelated to docking (yes, again due to the limitations of the salt processor), so be careful not to dock next to enemies who can shoot you down. Undocking is an equal but opposite reaction, taking 5 turns to leave a planet and leaving you without your systems. 
 
Once docked and colonizing a planet, your ship will mine the Halite automatically. With our patented Replicatron 5000, you will automatically produce more ships from the Halite you mine. The larger the planet, the more ships you can dock; the more ships you have docked, the more Halite you produce. Furthermore, the larger the planet, the more of the Halite the planet can produce in total.
 
You cannot colonize a planet that is already colonized: in such a case, you must destroy all docked enemy ships before proceeding to dock your own ships. However, should you feel vengeful, use this galaxy’s  patented ‘wind of the gods’ technique: crash into the planet enough times to destroy it. A planet can absorb one collision from a full-health ship for each ship it could have produced, so a planet that is capable of producing 10 ships will explode on the 10th collision.
 
This should be all the information you need for your mission, commander. The general should be waiting for you in the war room to give you his closing words.
 
## Winning Condition from the General

Hello again my pawn… I mean, commander. Now that you have been briefed, you should know exactly what to do: Destroy your enemies and/or conquer all planets, and you shall be victorious. As a reminder, your ship has enough fuel for approximately 300 turns, at which point you will be stranded. We will provide you more fuel in larger solar systems, giving you more time to maneuver and fight. We will consider ourselves fully victorious if we have mined the most of the Halite (produced the most ships). If unfortunately we have mined equally to our dreaded enemies, we will still be victorious if you have also destroyed the most of the enemy’s Halite (destroyed most enemy ships). It is a hard mission, but I would like to remind you that you have initialed this involuntary war participation form, so no there is no backing out now. Good luck - our whole civilization is depending on you.
