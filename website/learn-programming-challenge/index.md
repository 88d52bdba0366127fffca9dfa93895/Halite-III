Welcome to the Halite II competition!  If you’re here, that means you’re excited to make your first bot and get on the Halite II beta leaderboard. We’ll walk you through a few first steps, but there are many more documents for you to explore as you get better and better at building Halite bots.

## 1) LOG IN
    
The very first thing you need to do is [log in via Github][login] and fill out a bit more information for us to be able to make you a profile.

__Beta users:__ You can register using your personal GitHub email but please make sure to associate your Two Sigma email so we can add you to the Hackathon.

## 2) WATCH A FEW GAMES

Watch a few games to get a feel for how to play. You can go to the leaderboard, click on a user, and watch thier games.

You might also want to [browse the game rules], but it helps to watch some videos first.    


## 3) DOWNLOAD A BOT

Now it's time to [download the game environment and starter kit][downloads] for your platform and language of choice. Choose your prefered language:
    
- Python
- Java
- C++
    
Don’t see your language yet? [Let us know][contact]. We'll have documents on how to make your own bot in the language of you choice in the near future. If you cant wait for our write-up, we would highly recommend that you take a look at the Python/Java Starter kit to get an idea of how to implement a starter kit.
    
The game environment and starter kit are bundled together, so you should be all set.

## 4) VISUALIZE

Try running the bot with the provided `run_game.sh` or `run_game.bat` file. This will compile the bot and play it against itself automatically. When the game ends, it will produce a replay file (*.hlt) in the bot directory. Drag it to the [online visualizer][play] to see how the game went.

Make sure you have the tools you need to see if your bot is working as expected. You can also [upload a replay file][play] to see a game you played locally on your browser. 
    
## 5) PLAY
When you're ready, having hopefully tweaked a few variables in the starter bot, you should [submit your bot][play]. You can learn more about [submission rules][submit] in our documentation. 

Once the bot is done, you can see your results on on your user profile and/or you can [replay a file][play] and you’ll show up on the [leaderboard][leaderboard].
 
May the best bot win!
