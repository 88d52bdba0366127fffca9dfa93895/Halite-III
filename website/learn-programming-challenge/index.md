Welcome to the Halite II closed Two Sigma alpha competition!  If you’re here, that means you’re excited to make your first bot and get on the Halite II alpha leaderboard. We’ll walk you through a few first steps, but there are many more documents for you to explore as you get better and better at building Halite bots.

## 1) Log In
    
The very first thing you need to do is [log in via Github][login] and fill out a bit more information for us to be able to make you a profile.

__Beta users:__ please register under the Two Sigma organization, using your TS email address.
    
## 2) Download a Bot

Now it's time to [download the game environment and starter kit][downloads] for your platform and language of choice. Choose your prefered language:
    
- Python
- Java
- C++
    
Don’t see your language yet? [Let us know][contact]. We'll have documents on how to make your own bot after our alpha comeptition.
    
The game environment and starter kit are bundled together, so you should be all set.

## 3) Improve Your Bot

## 4) Visualize and Play Your Bot

Try running the bot with the provided `run_game.sh` or `run_game.bat` file. This will compile the bot and play it against itself automatically. When the game ends, it will produce a replay file (*.hlt) in the bot directory. Drag it to the [online visualizer][play] to see how the game went.

Make sure you have the tools you need to see if your bot is working as expected. Download the [offline visualizer] so you can play games before uploading your bot. You can also [upload a replay file][play] to see a game you played locally on your browser. 
    
When you're ready, having hopefully tweaked a few variables in the starter bot, you should [submit your bot][play]. You can learn more about [submission rules][submit] in our documentation. 

Once the bot is done, you can see your results on on your user profile and/or you can [replay a file][play] and you’ll show up on the [leaderboard][leaderboard].
 
You can reach us anytime at <mailto:halite@halite.io> for questions or support or use the HipChat room (Halite Chat) to ask us or other players a question.
