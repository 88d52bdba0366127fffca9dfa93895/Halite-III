## Guidelines

Before submitting a bot, make sure you adhere to our guidelines, or the upload or compilation of your bot will fail.

1. You should have a `MyBot.{extension for language}` in the root folder of your zip. For Rust, this should be a `cargo.toml`
2. If you are building on top of starter kit provided by us, make sure to include the hlt folder.

## Upload your bot

* Website: You can use the [play page](play-programming-challenge) in the Halite website to submit your bot.
* Halite Client: If you a command line experience, you can use the [Halite Client tool](/halite-cli-and-tools/upload-bots) to upload your bot.
