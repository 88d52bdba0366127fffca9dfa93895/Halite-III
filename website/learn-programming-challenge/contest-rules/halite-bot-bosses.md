While our matchmaking does not guarantee that you will play against these bots, these bots are a good indication of how your strategies compare how we think about difficulty levels.

As the game evolves, we expect some of these bots to drop their existing ranks fast. Check out where they are in the [leaderboard](/programming-competition-leaderboard?username=tsadmiral,tscaptain,tscommander,tscommander-ml) now.
