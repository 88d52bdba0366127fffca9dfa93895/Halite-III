Throughout the competition, [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com){:target="_blank"}, the creator of Halite, and its partners will be hosting hackathons for players to compete against smaller pools of players. Some examples include a High School hackathon in NYC in November and a public Hack Night at Cornell Tech.

## Join a hackathon

### If you’d like to join an existing hackathon, it’s easy to get started.

1. *Get a hackathon access code.* If you’re joining a public hackathon, the code will be available on the hackathon page, or if you’re joining a private hackathon and can’t find your code, you can email <halite@halite.io> to get a new code. 

2. *Add your code to your account* While you’re [signing up][login], you can add a hackathon code, or you can add a code by [editing your profile][edit profile].

3. *Verify your email* Some hackathons require that you verify a school or company email. You can do this by adding your email to your profile and then confirming by clicking the link in the email sent to you.

4. *Submit a bot during the dates of the hackathon* Once you’re all set, you can check that you’ve been added to the hackathon.

## Leaving a Hackthon?

If you want to leave a hackathon, email us at <mailto:halite@halite.io> with your Github email and the name of the hackathon you want to leave. 

## Create your own hackathon

You can also hold your own hackathon, Meetup, or classroom competition by creating a hackathon page on the Halite II website. 

### Follow these steps to get set up.

1. Email <halite@halite.io> the following content for your hackathon or event:

    - Hackathon or event name
    - Hackathon or event location
    - Start and end date
    - Description of your hackathon or event
    - Thumbnail image (optional)
    - Let us know if the hackathon is open to all or is private

2. You’ll get a page URL and signup code from the Halite team (expect a few business days for turnaround)

3. Share your signup code (and the instructions above for joining a hackathon) with your invitees!

### Tips and resources for a great hackathon

It can be hard to get started with Halite II - there are rules to learn, setup to do, and code to write. Here are what we believe are the keys to great Halite events:

- *Get people set up ahead of time:* Make sure your invitees have at least watched some games, skimmed the rules, created accounts, and/or joined the hackathon prior to arrival

- *Demo the game:* Show videos like [this][game example] of the best player’s bots. Watch in slow motion so participants can understand what’s happening by clicking on the ‘3x’ menu button.

- *Walk through basic bot improvements.* [This tutorial][improve bot] for how to improve the basic bot makes a great intro for new players.

- *Give bots time to calibrate.* Even if players submit bots on a given hack night, scores may not settle for a few more hours. Make sure you have a way to celebrate victory the next day after results are in.
