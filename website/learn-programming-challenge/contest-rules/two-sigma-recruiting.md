<a href=“https://www.twosigma.com” target=“_blank”>Two Sigma</a>, the creator of Halite, is excited to meet the exceptionally talented players of the Halite community. They will waive first round interviews for any Halite player who achieves Gold or above, and they are also organizing hackathons on many college campuses this fall.

## Recruiting for players Gold and above

Halite was created inside Two Sigma to teach players about AI and other advanced strategies, but due to its success it was opened to the public in fall of 2016 as a way to engage top engineers from around the world (as well as to have some fun!). Two Sigma has been extraordinarily impressed with the skills and enthusiasm of the Halite community, and invites any player who is in the Gold tier or above at the end of the competition to connect and skip the first offsite round of the Two Sigma interview process for engineering and modeling roles. Anyone interested will still follow the remaining steps of the interview process, and will be held to the same criteria as any other applicant after this first step. <a href=“https://careers.twosigma.com/careers/SearchJobs/?3_33_3=%5B%22898%22%2C%22887%22%2C%22890%22%5D&jobOffset=10” target=“_blank”>See some open positions here.</a>

## On-Campus Events and Recruiting

In an effort to bring a little more coding fun to college and university campuses, Two Sigma will be holding a number of virtual hackathons across North America where students can battle against their school classmates to be the victor of a three-week competition. The winners of each virtual hackathon may be invited to compete in a final competition in New York (expenses paid) and will be invited to on-site interview days. 

Additionally, any player who submits bots that score higher than Two Sigma’s <a href=“http://35.185.45.87/user/?user_id=1156” target=“_blank”>“Commander Bot”</a>will be eligible to interview with Two Sigma for college level roles (full time and internships), and scoring higher than the Commander also allows bot code to serve in place of a coding test.
