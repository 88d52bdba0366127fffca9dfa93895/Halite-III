        <h3>Coordinates &amp; Distances</h3>

        <p>Space is a 2D grid, where grid cells (not grid points) are identified by an X and Y coordinate. The top-left cell is cell (0, 0), with positive X extending towards the right and positive Y extending toward the bottom. All distances are Euclidean (<code>sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2)</code>). Note that this makes the coordinate system left-handed!</p>

        <h3 id="the-ether">The Ether</h3>

        <p>Unlike human space, Halatian space is filled with an Ether that slows down things passing through it. Your ships' velocity will not remain constant without acceleration, but instead slow by 3 units/turn. Take advantage of this, Commander: by moving at low speeds, you can avoid having to consider inertia, allowing you to perform precise movements so long as you are not in a hurry.</p>

    <div class="card-body">
        <p>The basic unit of your fleet; a nimble ship <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/learn/The-Story">built by depositing layers of pure Halite</a>. You start with three, but you'll want to make more.</p>

        <p>Ships are uniquely identified by the combination of player ID and the ship ID. However, in commands, you need only give the ship ID, as we assume you are not controlling the enemy ships.</p>
