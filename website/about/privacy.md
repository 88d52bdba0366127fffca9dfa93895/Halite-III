## YOU HAVE CERTAIN CHOICES ABOUT OUR MARKETING AND TRACKING TOOLS.

*You can opt out of receiving our marketing emails.*  To stop receiving our promotional emails, simply use the opt-out or unsubscribe method or manage preferences method provided in emails you receive from us. If you object to our use of your information for direct marketing purposes, please email us at <halite@halite.io>.

*You can control cookies and tracking tools.*  Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies.  How you do so depends on the type of cookie.  Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies.  To control flash cookies, which we may use on certain Sites from time to time, you can go here.  Why?  Because flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings.

This add-on instructs the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to prohibit sending visit information to Google Analytics. The Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on does not prevent data or information from being sent to the website itself or in other ways to web analytics services.

*Our Do Not Track Policy.* Some websites have “do not track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals.  If you block cookies, certain features on our Sites may not work.  If you block or reject cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop.
