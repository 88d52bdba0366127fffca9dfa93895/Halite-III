### Authors

Halite was primarily created by [Ben Spector](https://github.com/Sydriax) and [Michael Truell](https://github.com/truell20) for Two Sigma during their summer 2016 internship. However, many TSers contributed to Halite's developement, including [Matt Adereth](https://github.com/adereth), [Trammel Hudson](https://github.com/osresearch), and [Brian Wignall](https://github.com/bwignall).
