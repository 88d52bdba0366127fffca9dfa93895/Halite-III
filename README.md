## Authors

Halite was conceived of and developed by [Ben Spector](https://github.com/Sydriax) and [Michael Truell](https://github.com/truell20) in 2016. [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/), a company with a history of creating playful programming challenges, hosted the Halite I competition in 2016. Halite I was a success, developing a flourishing community of bot builders from around the globe who represented 35+ universities and 20+ organizations. In 2017, the Two Sigma team with Ben and Michael as advisors developed Halite II. Halite IIâ€™s new mechanics and backstory continued to grow the Halite community with participation from nearly 6,000 players from almost 1,000 organizations and over 100 countries around the world. The competition launched with support for a handful of programming languages; with contributions from the active community, the number of support languages surpassed 20 by the end of the competition.

In 2018, Two Sigma is proud to present the third open source Halite game. Halite III is a resource management game where artificial intelligence bots navigate the sea collecting halite. The Halite III competition allows players to develop bots with a variety of strategies and in multiple programming languages. Halite III was developed at Two Sigma by the Halite Team, with Ben and Michael returning as advisors.
