### Logo use guidelines

* Don't try to replicate the Halite logo in your own way (in a similar typeface and color, etc) or otherwise alter the logo.
* Always use the above resources to represent the logo as opposed to an image of the logo sourced elsewhere.
* Keep a minimum clearance of space between the logo and other visual elements akin to the images above.
* Please check with us before replicating the logo on any public materials you generate.

For any questions on logo usage, contact the Halite team at <mailto:halite@halite.io>.
